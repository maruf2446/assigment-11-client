            <h2 className="text-2xl">Question:1| What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where should we store them on the client-side?</h2>
            <p>An access token and a refresh token are commonly used in authentication and authorization protocols to grant secure access to resources on a server. Here's an explanation of what they are, how they work, and where they should be stored on the client-side.

                1. Access Token: An access token is a credential that represents the authorization granted to a client application to access specific resources on a server. It is usually a string of characters issued by an authentication server after a successful authentication process. The access token typically contains information like the client's identity and permissions, an expiration time, and other relevant details. When a client wants to access a protected resource on the server, it includes the access token in the request. The server then verifies the access token's validity and checks if the client has the required permissions to access the requested resource. If everything checks out, the server fulfills the request.

                2. Refresh Token: A refresh token is a credential used to obtain a new access token when the original access token expires. It is also issued by the authentication server during the authentication process but has a longer lifespan than the access token. The refresh token is securely stored on the client-side and should not be accessible to others. When an access token expires, the client sends the refresh token to the server. The server verifies the refresh token's validity and if it's valid, it generates a new access token and returns it to the client. This process allows the client to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

                3. Storage on the Client-side: Storing access tokens and refresh tokens securely on the client-side is crucial to prevent unauthorized access and potential token theft. Here are some common practices for storing tokens: Access Token: The access token is typically short-lived and is stored in memory, such as a variable, during the client's session. This allows easy access to the token when making API requests. However, it's important to note that storing sensitive tokens in memory can still pose security risks, especially in the case of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Refresh Token: The refresh token has a longer lifespan and should be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access. It is commonly stored in a secure HTTP-only cookie or local storage of the client-side application. Using an HTTP-only cookie helps protect the token from cross-site scripting attacks, as JavaScript cannot access it. Local storage is another option, but it's more vulnerable to XSS attacks, so it should be used with caution and appropriate security measures. It's important to follow best practices for token storage and ensure that appropriate security measures are implemented to protect both access tokens and refresh tokens on the client-side.</p>

            <p className="">SQL (Structured Query Language) databases follow a structured, relational data model with predefined schemas and enforce data integrity. They scale vertically and use SQL for querying. ACID compliance ensures data consistency. SQL databases are ideal for applications with complex relationships, such as financial systems and data warehousing. NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases have a flexible, schema-less data model. They scale horizontally, handle various data types, and may sacrifice some ACID properties for scalability and performance. NoSQL databases are suitable for large-scale, high-throughput applications like real-time analytics and content management systems. The choice between SQL and NoSQL depends on specific requirements and data characteristics.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl mt-20">Question:3| What is express js? What is Nest JS</h2>
            <p>Express.js is a minimalistic and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It focuses on simplicity and provides features for handling routing, middleware, and request/response handling. Nest.js is a progressive and opinionated framework built on top of Express.js. It follows the architectural pattern of Angular and offers a structured and modular approach to building scalable applications, incorporating concepts like modules, controllers, services, and decorators.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl mt-20">Question:4| What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work</h2>
            <p>MongoDB's aggregate is a powerful framework used for data aggregation and processing in MongoDB. It allows users to perform complex data transformations and analysis on collections of documents. The aggregate framework uses a pipeline approach, where multiple stages are chained together to transform and filter the data. Each stage in the pipeline performs a specific operation, such as matching, grouping, sorting, projecting, or aggregating data using various operators. These stages are executed sequentially, with the output of one stage becoming the input for the next. The aggregate framework provides a flexible and efficient way to extract insights and generate meaningful results from MongoDB data.</p>
